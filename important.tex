\title{Very Impressive Scientific Paper}

\maketitle

In this paper we will comunicate a very important scientific result.

\section{Introduction}

The finding we describe below has been sought after by competing groups
for years. In this section we will cite their publications and clearly
point out the ways in which our approach is superior.

\section{Theoretical background}

It's all in Griffiths. Cause everything is. 

\section{Experimental resluts}

Here we include several graphs of the data we
took, using well-coordinated colors that reproduce well in black and
white.

\section{Discussion}

Our hypothesis was correct. Some said it couldn't be done, but we
proved all of them wrong.

\section{Materials and Methods}

We used a very expensive Helium-3 cryostat and fabricated samples
in-house using reactive ion etching. Chirped pulse pairs were
generated using a homebuilt pulse shaper using a spatial light
modulator (SLM).

\section{Conlusion}

We expect a call from Stockholm at any moment. CAUSE NOBEL PRIZE BITCHESSSSSSS
